3. Check Network tab for failed API calls
4. Send me screenshot of:
   - Success/Error page
   - Console errors
   - Network tab showing payment-related calls

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Automated Test

If you want to test programmatically (without going through the UI):

```powershell
# Replace with your actual user ID from the database
$yourUserId = "YOUR_ACTUAL_USER_ID_HERE"

# Get current credits
$syncBody = "{`"userId`":`"$yourUserId`"}"
$beforeResp = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://italween.com/api/user/sync-credits" -Method POST -Body $syncBody -ContentType "application/json"
$beforeData = $beforeResp.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Credits BEFORE: $($beforeData.user.credits)"

# Create payment session
$paymentBody = "{`"amount`":1,`"currency`":`"USD`",`"packageId`":`"TEST`",`"credits`":22,`"userId`":`"$yourUserId`"}"
$sessionResp = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://italween.com/api/payment/create-session" -Method POST -Body $paymentBody -ContentType "application/json"
$sessionData = $sessionResp.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Payment URL: $($sessionData.paymentUrl)"
Write-Host "Order ID: $($sessionData.orderId)"

# Complete payment on MyFatoorah portal...
# Then check credits again
Read-Host "Press Enter after completing payment..."

$afterResp = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://italween.com/api/user/sync-credits" -Method POST -Body $syncBody -ContentType "application/json"
$afterData = $afterResp.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Credits AFTER: $($afterData.user.credits)"
Write-Host "Credits Added: $($afterData.user.credits - $beforeData.user.credits)"
```

## âœ… What I've Already Tested:
1. âœ… Create-session API works correctly
2. âœ… Payment callback endpoint responds
3. âœ… Idempotency checks are in place (prevents duplicate credits)
4. âœ… All payment packages (TEST, EXPLORER, CREATOR) create sessions successfully
5. âœ… Order IDs are generated correctly
6. âœ… MyFatoorah integration is configured

## ðŸŽ¯ What Needs Your Manual Test:
- Does the full payment flow work end-to-end?
- Are credits actually added to your account after payment?
- Does the success page show correctly?
- Can you verify in your account that credits increased?
