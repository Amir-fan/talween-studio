# MyFatoorah Payment Troubleshooting

## Current Configuration
- ‚úÖ API Key: Production (SSFCP-...)
- ‚úÖ Base URL: https://api.myfatoorah.com (Production)
- ‚úÖ Code: All correct

## Issue
Payment reaches MyFatoorah page, user enters card details, but payment fails and redirects to error page.

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Production Account Not Fully Activated
**Symptoms:**
- Can create payment sessions
- Can see payment page
- Payment fails when processing
- No money charged

**Solution:**
Contact MyFatoorah support to:
- Verify account is fully activated
- Enable credit card processing

### 2. Payment Methods Not Enabled
**Check:**
1. Log into MyFatoorah dashboard
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Payment Methods
3. Verify "Credit Card" is enabled
4. Check if there are any restrictions

### 3. Test the Code with Test Mode

To verify the code works, temporarily switch to test mode:

**In Vercel Environment Variables:**
1. Change `MYFATOORAH_BASE_URL` to: `https://apitest.myfatoorah.com`
2. Get your **TEST API key** from MyFatoorah dashboard
3. Change `MYFATOORAH_API_KEY` to your test key
4. Redeploy
5. Try payment with test card

**MyFatoorah Test Cards:**
- Card Number: `5123450000000008` (Mastercard)
- Expiry: Any future date
- CVV: Any 3 digits

If payment works in test mode ‚Üí Your code is fine, production account needs activation
If payment fails in test mode ‚Üí There's a code issue

## Next Steps

1. **Get Vercel Logs** for the failed payment:
   - Search for order: `order_1760045177030_o8tt17pqp`
   - Look for: `üîç [CALLBACK] Payment status check result:`
   - This will show what MyFatoorah returned

2. **Contact MyFatoorah Support:**
   - Email: support@myfatoorah.com
   - Tell them: "Production payments are failing, please verify my account is fully activated for credit card processing"
   - Provide them with a failed transaction ID: `090918307712317307110091`

3. **Check MyFatoorah Dashboard:**
   - Look for the failed transaction
   - Check what error message it shows
   - Verify payment methods are enabled

## Temporary Solution: Use Test Mode

While waiting for production activation, you can use test mode to verify everything works:

1. In Vercel, update environment variables:
   ```
   MYFATOORAH_BASE_URL=https://apitest.myfatoorah.com
   MYFATOORAH_API_KEY=[your test API key from MyFatoorah]
   ```

2. Redeploy

3. Test with test card: `5123450000000008`

This will let you verify the payment flow works while MyFatoorah activates your production account.
