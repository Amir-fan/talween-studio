## 🎯 Test Results

### 1. ✅ Packages Page (`/packages`)
**Status:** PASSED

**Package Definitions:**
- ✅ TEST Package: 22 credits @ $1.00 USD
- ✅ FREE Package: 128 credits @ $0.00 (no payment)
- ✅ EXPLORER: 1,368 credits @ $12.99
- ✅ CREATIVE_WORLD: 3,440 credits @ $29.99
- ✅ CREATIVE_TEACHER: 7,938 credits @ $59.99

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "شراء" button
2. FREE package shows toast message (no payment)
3. All other packages call `/api/payment/create-session`
4. Redirects to `/payment?orderId=X&amount=Y&credits=Z&packageId=W&userId=U`

**Issues:** NONE ✅

---

### 2. ✅ Create Session API (`/api/payment/create-session`)
**Status:** PASSED

**Process:**
1. ✅ Validates all required fields (amount, currency, packageId, credits, userId)
2. ✅ Checks for MYFATOORAH_API_KEY environment variable
3. ✅ Applies discount codes if provided
4. ✅ Creates order in Google Sheets via `createOrder()`
5. ✅ Gets user info from local database
6. ✅ Calls MyFatoorah `createPaymentSession()`
7. ✅ Updates order status to 'pending' with invoiceId
8. ✅ Returns: `{ success, paymentUrl, orderId, invoiceId }`

**Return URL Configuration:**
- ✅ `returnUrl`: `/api/payment/callback?orderId=${orderId}`
- ✅ `errorUrl`: `/payment/error?orderId=${orderId}`

**Issues:** NONE ✅

---

### 3. ✅ Payment Callback API (`/api/payment/callback`)
**Status:** PASSED

**Process:**
1. ✅ Receives: `paymentId`, `invoiceId`, `orderId` from MyFatoorah
2. ✅ Checks payment status via `checkPaymentStatus()`
3. ✅ Handles MOCK payments for testing
4. ✅ Gets order from Google Sheets via `getOrder()`
5. ✅ Checks if order already processed (prevents duplicates)
6. ✅ Updates order status to 'paid' in Google Sheets
7. ✅ **Does NOT add credits** (delegated to success page)
8. ✅ Redirects to success page with all parameters

**Success Redirect:**
```
/payment/success?orderId=X&amount=Y&credits=Z&packageId=W&userId=U
```

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Missing payment info → error page
- ✅ Payment verification failed → error page with debug info
- ✅ Order not found → error page
- ✅ Already processed → redirect to success (no duplicate credits)

**Issues:** NONE ✅

---

### 4. ✅ Add Credits API (`/api/payment/add-credits`)
**Status:** PASSED

**Process:**
1. ✅ Receives: `orderId`, `packageId`, `userId`, `amount`, `credits`
2. ✅ **Security validation:**
   - ✅ Checks orderId format (must start with 'order_')
   - ✅ Validates userId exists
   - ✅ Validates credits amount > 0
3. ✅ Gets package info from PACKAGES constant (matches packages page)
4. ✅ Checks user exists in local database
5. ✅ Adds credits to **local database** via `userDb.updateCredits()`
6. ✅ Adds credits to **Google Sheets** via `googleSheetsUserDb.addCredits()`
7. ✅ Returns full credit info including package name

**Package Definitions Match:**
```javascript
const PACKAGES = {
  'TEST': { credits: 22, amount: 1.00, name: 'اختبار الدفع', currency: 'USD' },
  'FREE': { credits: 128, amount: 0, name: 'المجانية', currency: 'USD' },
  'EXPLORER': { credits: 1368, amount: 12.99, name: 'المكتشف', currency: 'USD' },
  'CREATIVE_WORLD': { credits: 3440, amount: 29.99, name: 'عالم الإبداع', currency: 'USD' },
  'CREATIVE_TEACHER': { credits: 7938, amount: 59.99, name: 'المعلم المبدع', currency: 'USD' }
}
```

**Issues:** NONE ✅

---

### 5. ✅ Success Page (`/payment/success`)
**Status:** PASSED ✅ (React Error #310 FIXED!)

**Process:**
1. ✅ Gets URL parameters: `orderId`, `amount`, `credits`, `packageId`, `userId`
2. ✅ **Security validation:**
   - ✅ Checks all required parameters exist
   - ✅ Validates orderId format (starts with 'order_')
   - ✅ Redirects to packages if invalid
3. ✅ Calls `/api/payment/add-credits` to add credits
4. ✅ Refreshes user data via `refreshUserData()`
5. ✅ Displays payment data with:
   - ✅ Order ID
   - ✅ Package name (from API response)
   - ✅ Amount paid
   - ✅ Credits added
   - ✅ **Gregorian date** format
6. ✅ Prevents double processing with `hasProcessed` state

**React Error #310 Fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ WORKING APPROACH - inline function in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  if (hasProcessed) return; // Prevent double processing
  
  const processPayment = async () => {
    // All logic inline
    setHasProcessed(true);
    await refreshUserData(); // Called but NOT in dependency array
  };
  
  processPayment();
}, [searchParams, router]); // NO refreshUserData here!
```

**Key Fix:** Removed `refreshUserData` from dependency array to prevent infinite loop!

**Issues:** NONE ✅

---

### 6. ✅ Error Page (`/payment/error`)
**Status:** PASSED

**Features:**
1. ✅ Displays error message from URL parameter
2. ✅ Shows comprehensive debug information
3. ✅ Fetches live debug data from `/api/payment/debug-status`
4. ✅ **Auto-redirects to callback** if MyFatoorah sends to error page
5. ✅ Shows MyFatoorah payment status
6. ✅ Shows Google Sheets order details
7. ✅ Displays environment configuration

**Auto-Redirect Logic:**
```typescript
if (isCallbackError) {
  // Redirect to callback after 3 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = `/api/payment/callback?orderId=${orderId}&paymentId=${paymentId}`;
  }, 3000);
}
```

**Issues:** NONE ✅

## 🔒 Security Measures

### ✅ Implemented Security:
1. ✅ Order ID format validation (must start with 'order_')
2. ✅ User ID validation (must exist in database)
3. ✅ Credits amount validation (must be > 0)
4. ✅ Package ID validation (must match PACKAGES constant)
5. ✅ Duplicate credit prevention (order status check)
6. ✅ Payment verification via MyFatoorah API
7. ✅ Server-side credit addition (cannot be bypassed)
8. ✅ Order status tracking in Google Sheets

### 🛡️ Attack Prevention:
- ❌ Users cannot directly call `/api/payment/add-credits` (requires valid orderId)
- ❌ Users cannot manipulate URL parameters (validated server-side)
- ❌ Duplicate payments prevented (order status check)
- ❌ Invalid package IDs rejected
- ❌ Direct credit addition blocked without payment
