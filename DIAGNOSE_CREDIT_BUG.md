# üö® CRITICAL BUG: Credits Being ADDED Instead of DEDUCTED

## Problem Report
User generated an image (text-to-coloring) and received **+700 credits** instead of having 35 credits deducted!

## Expected Behavior
- Cost: 35 credits (TEXT_TO_COLORING)
- Action: DEDUCT 35 credits
- Result: `user.credits = user.credits - 35`

## Actual Behavior  
- User got **+700 credits** added to their account!

## Possible Causes

### 1. Wrong Action Being Called
- Maybe `addCredits` is being called instead of `deductCredits`
- **STATUS:** ‚úÖ Code analysis shows correct `deductCredits` calls

### 2. Sign Error (Negative becomes Positive)
- Maybe passing `-35` which becomes `+35` somewhere
- **NEED TO CHECK:** Actual API calls and Google Sheets logs

### 3. Multiplication Error
- 700 / 35 = 20x multiplication
- Maybe looping 20 times?
- **NEED TO CHECK:** Execution logs

### 4. Google Sheets Script Error
- Maybe the Apps Script has the wrong logic
- **STATUS:** ‚úÖ Apps Script code looks correct (line 586: `newCredits = currentCredits - deductAmount`)

### 5. Local DB vs Sheets Mismatch
- Maybe deducting from one but adding to another
- **NEED TO CHECK:** Both databases

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check Current User Credits
```powershell
# Replace with actual user ID
$userId = "YOUR_USER_ID"
$body = "{`"userId`":`"$userId`"}"
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://italween.com/api/user/sync-credits" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$data = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Current Credits: $($data.user.credits)"
```

### Step 2: Check Google Sheets Directly
1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet
2. Find the user's row
3. Check the Credits column value
4. Note the exact number

### Step 3: Test Deduction Manually
```powershell
# Test deducting 35 credits
$userId = "YOUR_USER_ID"
$body = "{`"userId`":`"$userId`",`"amount`":35}"
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://italween.com/api/user/deduct-credits" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$data = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Result: $($data | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5)"
```

### Step 4: Check Browser Console Logs
When you generate an image, open browser console (F12) and look for:
- `üîç CLIENT CREDIT CHECK`
- `üí≥ DEDUCT CREDITS API`
- `‚ûñ [GS] deductCredits`
- Any credit-related logs

Look for:
- What amount is being passed?
- Is it positive or negative?
- What's the response?

### Step 5: Check Server Logs (Vercel)
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check the logs for the last generation
3. Search for keywords: "deductCredits", "addCredits", "credits"
4. Look for the actual API calls and responses

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Add Validation to Prevent Negative Deductions
Update `src/lib/google-sheets-server.ts`:
```typescript
async deductCredits(userId: string, amount: number): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string }> {
  // VALIDATION: Ensure amount is positive
  if (amount <= 0) {
    console.error('‚ùå Invalid deduction amount:', amount);
    return { success: false, error: 'Deduction amount must be positive' };
  }
  
  try {
    console.log('‚ûñ [GS] deductCredits:', { userId, amount });
    // ... rest of code
```

### Fix 2: Add Detailed Logging
Update `src/app/create/word/server-actions.ts` (TEXT_TO_COLORING):
```typescript
const creditCheck = await checkAndDeductCreditsForFeature(
  values.userId, 
  'TEXT_TO_COLORING',
  `ÿ™ÿ≠ŸàŸäŸÑ ŸÅŸÉÿ±ÿ© ŸÜÿµŸäÿ© ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿµŸÅÿ≠ÿ© ÿ™ŸÑŸàŸäŸÜ: ${values.description}`,
  values.userEmail
);
console.log('üîç DETAILED CREDIT CHECK:', {
  userId: values.userId,
  feature: 'TEXT_TO_COLORING',
  cost: 35,
  result: creditCheck,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

### Fix 3: Check if Multiple Requests
Maybe the generation is happening multiple times? Add request tracking:
```typescript
// At the top of server-actions.ts
const processingRequests = new Set<string>();

export async function generateImageAction(values) {
  const requestKey = `${values.userId}-${Date.now()}`;
  
  if (processingRequests.has(values.userId)) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è DUPLICATE REQUEST DETECTED for user:', values.userId);
    return { success: false, error: 'Request already processing' };
  }
  
  processingRequests.add(values.userId);
  try {
    // ... normal processing
  } finally {
    processingRequests.delete(values.userId);
  }
}
```

## Immediate Action Required

**I need you to provide:**
1. Your user ID
2. Your current credit balance (check on the website)
3. Your credit balance in Google Sheets (check the spreadsheet directly)
4. Any browser console errors/logs when you generated the image
5. What happened exactly - did it generate successfully?

**Then I can:**
- Test the exact scenario
- Check the logs
- Identify the root cause
- Deploy a fix immediately

## Prevention Measures

Once we fix this, we should add:
1. ‚úÖ Input validation (amount must be positive)
2. ‚úÖ Detailed logging for all credit operations
3. ‚úÖ Request deduplication
4. ‚úÖ Credit operation audit log
5. ‚úÖ Alerts for abnormal credit changes (> 100 credits)
