## 🎯 **Testing Approach**

I will test what I CAN verify through code analysis:
- ✅ Code paths exist
- ✅ Imports are correct
- ✅ Services are called properly
- ✅ Error handling is present
- ✅ Logic flows are valid

I CANNOT test (requires manual verification):
- ❌ Actual API responses
- ❌ Real database writes
- ❌ MyFatoorah payment gateway
- ❌ User interface interactions
- ❌ Network requests
