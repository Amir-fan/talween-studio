## Step 2: Deploy as Web App

2. Choose "Web app" as the type
3. Set "Execute as" to "Me"
4. Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Copy the Web App URL (it will look like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec`)

## Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# Google Apps Script Email Service
GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec

# Google Sheets Integration (if you want it)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id_here

JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-here
```

## Step 4: Test Email Service

1. Restart your development server
2. Try creating a new account
3. Check the console logs for email sending status
4. Check your email for verification links

## Email Templates Included
